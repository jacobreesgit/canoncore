**✅ 8.2**: Public Universe Discovery (Complete)

- Public universes page using same design as existing universes page
- Simple list/search of public universes from all users
- Add "Browse Public Universes" section to sidebar navigation

**✅ 8.3**: Navigation & User Experience Consolidation (Complete)

**Problem:** Current sidebar mixing user profile display with navigation creates visual clutter and unclear user flows.

**Solution:** Clean separation of concerns with navigation-focused sidebar and consolidated user dashboard:

**Navigation Sidebar Changes:**
- Remove UserProfile card component entirely from sidebar
- Replace with clean navigation buttons following "Browse Public Universes" pattern:
  - 🏠 Dashboard (replaces "Your Universes", leads to user's home page)
  - 🌍 Browse Public (existing)
  - ⭐ Favourites (future Phase 8.4)
- Consistent button styling: emoji + label, hover effects, rounded corners
- Logo area remains unchanged

**User Dashboard Page (`/[username]`):**
- Merge profile information with universe grid on single page
- Top section: Compact user profile (name, username, universe count) + Create Universe action
- Main section: Universe grid (existing design)
- Same route, enhanced functionality - no breaking changes

**User Actions Relocation:**
- Move Sign Out and Delete Account to header user avatar dropdown
- Header pattern: [Breadcrumbs] ──────── [👤 Avatar ▼] with dropdown menu
- Follows standard app conventions (GitHub, Discord, Slack pattern)
- Mobile: Existing ResponsiveHeader hamburger already handles this

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner visual hierarchy with single-purpose sidebar
- Scalable navigation pattern for future features
- Standard UX patterns users expect
- Reduced cognitive load and visual clutter
- Better mobile experience
